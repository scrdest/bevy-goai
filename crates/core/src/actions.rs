//! Actions and ActionTemplates.
//! 
//! An Action is the ultimate output of the AI engine - it is largely what it sounds like, 
//! a generic behavior of some sort, for example moving, attacking, using items, etc., 
//! possibly taking multiple ticks to conclude (as opposed to a one-off trigger only).
//! 
//! The first caveat is that Actions are independent of their implementation - AI code cares 
//! not about how you implement your movement or combat systems, an Action is merely a request 
//! to run some code that will implement it properly (with hooks to signal when it's done running).
//! 
//! The second caveat is that we are not necessarily only talking about individual NPCs!
//!  
//! A single AI can be the 'brain' of a single NPC, but we can also have 'Commander' AIs 
//! driving whole teams or crowds, 'Director' AIs whose target (Pawn) is 'the game world'
//! (e.g. running spawners, or coordinating other AIs goals to drive story progression), 
//! and conversely, a single NPC or Faction can be run by multiple AIs working together.
//! 
//! An Action is composed of two parts: an ActionTemplate and an ActionContext. 
//! 
//! You can think of that as 'function' and 'parameters', more or less - the 
//! Template represents a capability, e.g. the ability to pick up items, while the 
//! Context represents what we're doing it *to* (e.g. which item to pick up). 
//! 
//! An Action will usually have multiple possible available Contexts to choose from. 
//! 
//! This is the core problem AI solves - given all ActionTemplates and all Contexts 
//! available for them at a given moment, which combination to choose for execution?
