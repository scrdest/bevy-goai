//! Utility Curves - pure functions on a unit interval that modulate Consideration responses.
//! 
//! There is nothing particularly special or complex about these; 
//! they are, by and large, a subset of Bevy's generic Curves. 
//! 
//! For Utility AI purposes, all Curves have a unit interval domain (i.e. 0.0 to 1.0), 
//! and a range of values that is ALSO a unit interval (visually, forming a 1x1 square).
//! On top of that most of them are fairly simple and cheap (by necessity).
//! 
//! The main purpose of these Curves is to make Considerations more *expressive*.
//! 
//! A Consideration will give us the current Health, but should the Action score 
//! be higher (e.g. for RecklessAttack) or lower (e.g. for Heal) the higher the 
//! Health value is? Or perhaps the highest score should be around the middle? 
//! And even if higher is better, does 10% higher == 10% better, or is it nonlinear?
//! 
//! Curves provide us with the tool to handle this by mapping from the input to the output smoothly.
//! 
//! To use a Curve, simply include its key in the ActionSet JSON data for some object. 
//! The Consideration inputs will be automatically scaled to the right input range and 
//! fed through the Curve by the scoring system.
//! 
//! If you plan on using custom Curves, you will need to register them into the library 
//! by initializing the `UtilityCurveRegistry` Resource with `app.add_resource()` and 
//! using the `UtilityCurveRegistry.register_curve()` method with some key (as long 
//! as it does not conflict with a built-in key!)
//! 
//! The most important items in this module, in descending order, are:
//! 1) The `UtilityCurveRegistry` Resource, which allows you to register your own Curves
//! 2) The `UtilityCurve` trait which defines what a 'registrable' Curve is for the `UtilityCurveRegistry`
//! 3) The `SupportedUtilityCurve` enum which holds all built-in Utility Curves - those are a curated 
//!    selection of building blocks that should cover the majority of your needs. They are also slightly 
//!    more performant due to the lack of an Arc<T> overhead and a secondary registry lookup.
//! 4) The methods of UtilityCurveExt - if you are planning to create custom Utility Curves, this  
//!    trait provides constructors for various transforms that are still valid as Utility Curves.
